PEAKY BLINDERS is an epic gangster family saga that takes place in a dangerous, romantic, elevated, visceral world, where the men are handsome and heroic and the women are beautiful and indomitable. The setting is the back streets of 1920s Birmingham, a city of steel plants, criminal gangs, gypsies, canals… an unseen side of Britain’s history. The world of the original British gangster.

The series focuses on the Shelby family, whose many brothers and sisters, cousins and uncles, make up the fiercest gang of all, the ‘Peaky Blinders’. Named for their practice of sewing razor blades into the peaks of their caps, the Peaky Blinders make their money from off-track betting, protection and robbery.

The Peaky Blinders are led by Tommy Shelby (Cillian Murphy), the most violent brother of them all, but his leadership is about to be put to the test. A merciless Police Chief C.I. Campbell (Sam Neill) arrives from Belfast to clean up the city and, perhaps even more dangerous, a beautiful woman named Grace Burgess (Annabelle Wallis) arrives in the neighborhood with a mysterious past and a dangerous secret.
