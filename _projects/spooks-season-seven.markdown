Following the success of Season 6’s long running story, this time the primary storyline involves Sugarhorse, a top secret operation set up by MI5 during the final years of the Cold War, and a mole working for the FSB who intends to leak the operation to the Russians. It also saw the introduction of new MI5 operative, Lucas North (Richard Armitage) and the death of Adam Carter (Rupert Penry-Jones). Some of the season was shot in Moscow.

The seventh season attracted critical acclaim, with some reviewers considering it to be the best season of Spooks. The seventh season was nominated for a British Academy Television Award (BAFTA) for “Best Drama Series” in 2009, but lost to Wallander. Because of the strong ratings and positive feedback from fans and critics, the BBC announced they would recommission Spooks for an eighth season for 2009 in 4 December 2008, just days before the finale was set to air.
