LUTHER is a dark psychological crime drama in which John Luther (Idris Elba), is a man struggling with his own terrible demons, might just be as dangerous as the depraved murderers he hunts. His only confidante, and perhaps his worst enemy, is a multiple-murderess whom he failed to see convicted for the slaughter of her own family.

The series takes the form of six stand-alone episodes interlaced with a unique serial arc. We see Luther confront depravity and evil in its many terrible forms. We also watch him walk to the edge of murder… and perhaps beyond. Because Luther is a deeply troubled man, possessed by the insoluble problem of evil and justice in a world without God.

From the opening credits to the end of season one, “Luther” is a fast paced mystery presented with many plot twists and insights into the human psyche.
